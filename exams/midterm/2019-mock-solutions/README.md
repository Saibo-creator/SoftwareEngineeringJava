# Software Engineering - Mock Midterm

This is the mock midterm, designed to get you familiar with the SwEng exam infrastructure before the midterm itself.

We will grade using a snapshot of the `master` branch of this repository from GitHub, not your machine.
We will take this snapshot and terminate your access to this repository at **13:15 on October 25, 2019**.

Commit and push your work often during the exam, to make sure you don't lose your changes. 
We will use the latest commit that builds successfully to grade your work, rolling back any newer commits that fail to build.
However, we will not roll back more than that, so please be careful to not accidentally overwrite your work.

We use automated scripts to extract the answers from your repository, so please follow the instructions to the letter.

We strongly advise that you read each problem statement at least twice.
You need to provide a correct answer to the _correct_ question in order to receive full credit.
A correct answer to a _wrong or misinterpreted_ question will not earn credit.
If you have any doubts, ask the SwEng staff.

Exam rules:
- Use your own laptop to do the work.
- You are not allowed to wear headphones during the exam.
- The exam is open-book, so you can consult any resource during the exam (website, class material, StackOverflow, etc.),
  but you are not permitted to copy code from any such resource, and the resource must have been created prior to the start of the exam.
- Please note in your exam solution what external resources you used (e.g., URLs). Using external resources without noting them in the exam constitutes cheating.
- You may use code that you wrote for this class prior to the start of the exam, or code from the lectures.
- You are not allowed to interact with or receive any assistance from any human being during the exam other than the course staff.
  Any use of Facebook, Email, SMS, Skype, TeamViewer, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. will be automatically deemed to be cheating and will be treated accordingly.
  We may monitor network traffic in and out of the exam rooms, so please make sure that any background email agents and equivalent that you may have on your laptop are stopped.
- If you wish to leave early, you must show your CAMIPRO card to one of the course staff and await their confirmation that you can indeed leave; we will turn off access to your exam repository at that time.
- If you leave early without showing your CAMIPRO card to the staff, you will not receive any points for the exam.
- Toward the end of the exam, the staff may ask you to remain seated, in order to avoid disturbing students who want to work until the end of the exam time slot.
- If you need to use the bathroom during the exam, you must be escorted by a member of the staff.
  Leaving the room without being escorted will be treated as an early departure: your repository will be locked, and you will not be permitted re-entry into the exam room.

This exam is worth 100 points in total, and you have 120 minutes (2 hours) to complete it. The exam consists of two parts:

**Part 1: Theory [40 points]**

Please see [THEORY.md](THEORY.md) in this folder.

**Part 2: Practice [60 points]**

Please see [PRACTICE.md](PRACTICE.md) in this folder.
