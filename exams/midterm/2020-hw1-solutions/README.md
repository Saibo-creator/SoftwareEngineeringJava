# Software Engineering - Homework 1

This homework constitutes graded, individual work, so you are not permitted to discuss it with anyone, you are not permitted to share code with anyone, and you must treat this homework the same way you would treat an exam. Any violations of this policy will be handled in accordance with EPFL's cheating and plagiarism rules.

This homework comes from the `student-GASPAR` repo in the `sweng-epfl` GitHub organization.
Push your answers to the `master` branch in this repo.

Grading will be done on a snapshot of the `master` branch of this repository from GitHub, not your machine. The snapshot will be taken at **23:59 on Friday, 16-Oct-2020**, and access to this repo will be terminated at that point. You can start any time you wish. Please be careful not to overwrite your work, as we will not roll back your commits. Commit and push your work often, to make sure you don't lose local changes and to mitigate the risk of GitHub going down shortly before the deadline. We use automated scripts to extract the answers from your repo, so follow the instructions exactly, and do not place stray characters in the files you push.

We strongly advise that you read each problem statement at least twice. You need to provide a correct answer to the _correct_ question in order to receive full credit. A correct answer to a _wrong or misinterpreted_ question will not earn credit. If you have any doubts, ask the SwEng staff via [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ketonvc4q9k2fx) or during the exercises session on Friday.

Homework rules:

- Use your personal laptop to do the work.
- The homework is open-book, so you can consult any resource during the homework (website, class material, StackOverflow, etc.) but you are not permitted to copy code from any such resource, and the resource must have been created prior to the start of the homework.
- You may use code that you or your team wrote for this class prior, or code from the lectures.
- You are not permitted to interact with or receive or give any assistance from any human being in relation to the homework, except from the course staff.
- Please note in your solution what external resources you used (e.g., URLs). Using external resources without noting them in the homework constitutes plagiarism.
- You may submit your solution any time before the deadline, and you can go back and modify it before the deadline.

The homework is worth 100 points in total, and it consists of three parts:

**Part 1: Theory [20 points]**

Please see [THEORY.md](THEORY.md) in this repo.

**Part 2: Practice [78 points]**

Please see [PRACTICE.md](PRACTICE.md) in this repo.

**Part 3: Survey [2 points]**

Please fill out this [anonymous survey](https://...) for 2 points. Moodle will tell us who filled out the survey and who didn't, but will not tell who filled out which survey.
