## Mock Midterm Exam 

This mock midterm exam comes from the `exams-GASPAR` repo in the `sweng-epfl` GitHub organization.
This repo will contain all the exams you will take this semester in SwEng.
Please push your answers to this repo on the `master` branch. 


We will not grade this _mock_ exam, but for the _real_ exams grading will be done on a snapshot of this repository from GitHub, not your machine. Please be careful not to overwrite your work, as we will not roll back commits. Commit and push your work often during the exam, to make sure you don't lose local changes and to mitigate the risk of GitHub going down shortly before the end of the exam. We use automated scripts to extract the answers from your repo, so follow the instructions exactly, and do not place stray characters in the files you push.

This mock midterm exam is a replica of last year's midterm exam.
It will help you get used to the SwEng exam workflow using Java, GitHub, Travis CI, and CodeClimate.

Midterm exam rules:

- Use your laptop to do the work.
- The exam is open-book, so you can consult any resource during the exam (website, class material, StackOverflow, etc.) but you are not permitted to copy code from any such resource, and the resource must have been created prior to the start of the exam.
- You may use code that you or your SDP team (if any) wrote for this class prior to the start of the exam, or code from the lectures.
- You are not permitted to interact with or receive any assistance from any human being during the exam other than the course staff.  Any use of Facebook, Email, Hangouts, IRC, phone, SMS, Skype, TeamViewer, etc. will be automatically deemed to be cheating and will be treated accordingly.
During the exams, we may monitor network traffic in and out of the exam rooms, so please make sure that any background email agents and equivalent that you may have on your laptop are stopped. 
- Please note in the exam solution what external resources you used (e.g., URLs). 
- You are not permitted to wear headphones during the exam.
- If you wish to leave early, you must show your CAMIPRO card to one of the course staff and await their confirmation that you can indeed depart; we will turn off access to your exam repo at that time.
- If you leave early without showing your CAMIPRO card to one of the staff, you will not receive any points for the exam.
- Toward the end of the exam, the staff may ask you to remain seated, in order to avoid disturbing students who want to work until the end of the exam timeslot.
- If you need to use the bathroom during the exam, you must be escorted by a member of the staff. Leaving the room without an escort prior to you having turned in your exam will be treated as an early departure.

The midterm exam is worth 100 points in total, and you will have 165 minutes (2 hours and 45 minutes) to complete it.

The mock midterm exam consists of two parts:

**Part 1: Practice [60 points]**
