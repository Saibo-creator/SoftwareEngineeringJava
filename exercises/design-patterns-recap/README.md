# Design patterns recap: exercise set

You should already be familiar with several design patterns. However as you probably haven't practiced them for a while, we provide you this exercise set to refresh your knowledge on the following design patterns if you need it :

- Iterator
- Builder
- Decorator
- Composite
- Adapter
- Observer

:information_source: Feel free to only solve the exercises for the DPs you need a refresher about. While we are expecting you to know about these 6 design patterns, you don't need to solve the exercises about the ones you already feel very comfortable about.
