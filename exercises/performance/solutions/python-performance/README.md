Performance in Python
=======

###  How to run .ipynb files:

We recommend you run these files remotely, using a service such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [EPFL Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch). Just follow these links, upload the relevant files, and you should be good to go. If you're using EPFL Noto, you will need to install the `numba` module, as it is not there by default.

You can also run these notebooks on a local environment if you want, just make sure that the `numpy` and `numba` modules are installed. To install a local Python environment, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
