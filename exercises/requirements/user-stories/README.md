# User stories - university application

Imagine you work for a company that wanted to develop an application for universities management. You received a description of what the program should do and your task is to write more specific user stories about this.

Here is the description:

> The program will be the administrative backbone of the university. Almost all collaborators will use it. The HR (Human resources) will record each collaborator on it, they will pay the salaries through it as well. Academic services will register students with all their personal information and then use the system to be sure that every student follows the rules for their cursus (duration of the studies, number of credits, payment of the bill). Professors will enter the grades and use this tool to send messages to the students registered in their lessons (like an announcements channel, not a forum nor a chat). Students will be able to browse available courses, register for the one they want, track their results (grades and credits they got), pay the bill, and update their personal information. Collaborators can access the program to change their personal information (address, bank account for the salary). Each type of user must be able to access the functions she needs but not more. 

Your task is to extract from this description as many user stories as you can. The stories should have the following form:

> As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [goal/expected outcome].
