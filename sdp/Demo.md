# Doing a demo in SDP

An important part of every sprint review is a demo of your app. The first thing you need, of course, is a working app every week. It's important that it works, even if it has reduced functionality.

Start with an **elevator pitch**. Imagine the following scenario: you walk into an elevator and, oh my God!, there is the person you've always dreamt of meeting and convincing to adopt your app for her multi-national organization. So you now have an elevator ride's worth of time to pitch your app, to explain the concept in a way that she can understand it and be convinced. You must answer three key questions: Who is the app for? What does it do? Why is it needed? Answer these questions in 30-60 seconds. (Note that an elevator pitch is not the same thing as a sales pitch)

After the elevator pitch, **demo your app**. This should take no more than 5 minutes. Do not give a tour of the features and functions but rather tell a user story and use the app as a companion. Instead of "Here you see the main menu, which allows you to find friends, determine where they are located, and send them messages..." you might try something like "Imagine you are downtown Lausanne and you have half an hour to kill until your next commitment. You take out your phone and look to see if there are any friends around. Aha! There is one. You message him ..."

The #1 rule of demos is that [they don't work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znxQOPFg2mo). Avoid enforcing the rule! A successful demo requires that you rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse. Please come prepared to class, and don't squander your chance to show off the app. Think ahead of time of the conditions in the room and what might go wrong. Will you show directly the screen of the phone, or will you project it using a beamer? How will the lighting be? Will you allow your audience to interact with the app? Do you require network connectivity? GPS? Etc.

Every member of the team must pitch and demo the app at least once during the semester. If you think that doing this is not your cup of tea, please watch [this video](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are).

After practicing the pitch and the demo throughout the semester, the Battle of the Apps will be the easiest thing ever.
